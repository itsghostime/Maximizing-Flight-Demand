## Project Background

Operations in the airline industry, focusing on global passenger travel across major countries. With over 98,000 annual flights in 2022, the airline aims to provide seamless travel experiences while optimizing operational efficiency. The airline's business model revolves around analyzing trends in passenger behavior, improving on-time performance, and enhancing overall flight operations. Key metrics include passenger counts, flight delays, and seasonal travel trends. 

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- Passenger Demographics Analysis: Evaluation of passenger distribution across nationalities, age groups, and genders to understand key customer segments and their travel patterns.

- Flight Status Trends: Analysis of on-time performance, delays, and cancellations to identify operational efficiencies and areas requiring improvement.

- Seasonal and Regional Impacts: Examination of flight volumes and delays across different months, weekdays, and regions to highlight demand trends and operational bottlenecks.

### Overview of Findings
In 2022, the airline industry demonstrated consistent travel demand, with over 98,000 flights and a clear preference for summer travel. Adults, particularly Chinese and Indonesian nationals, made up the majority of passengers, highlighting lucrative marketing opportunities in these demographics. However, operational challenges persist, as North America experiences the highest delays (60%), especially on weekdays, with peak disruptions occurring in January and July. While these values can be attributed to airlines recovering from the pandemic, the following sections will explore additional factors and strategies that can be improved upon to enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
